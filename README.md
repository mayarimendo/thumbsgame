>The Thumbs Single-Player Game website is the online version of a multiplayer game.
The original game takes any number of people and is a game of predictions.
__explain game__.
In this version of the game, there are four players, and the user is playing against 3 bots, or a player that does automated tasks.
The purpose of the Thumbs Single-Player Game is to allow a single player, the user, to play the thumbs game alone, in the absence of other *real* players to play against.

>So what does the user do in the game?
In the online single-player version, the user can, at any given time, select the number of thumbs they will have up before checking if the bot or user prediction is correct.
The user can also select their own prediction for the number of thumbs that will be up *when it is their turn*.
When it's not the user's turn, the button for the user to make a prediction will be disabled.
